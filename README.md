# Digraph Computing Model

This project is a reference implementation for a computing model
which represents both data and program as a Digraph with unweighted 
unlabeled edges. 

I have found limited practical application for this project and it is currently
"shelved," if you have any questions about the project feel free to contact
me at kylebrw@gmail.com
